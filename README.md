# Bus Ticket Management 

Welcome to Bus Ticket Management! This project utilizes Hardhat for Ethereum development. 

To get started:

- Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
- Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
- After installing dependencies, run tests with `npx hardhat test` to ensure everything functions correctly.
- Next, start a Hardhat node by running `npx hardhat node` to interact with the Ethereum network locally.
- In a separate terminal, execute the deployment script with `npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`.
- Finally, start the frontend application with `npm run start` to interact with the deployed contracts.
